# Fitness Dashboard

This project is a Vite application built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Zustand**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It includes a responsive design and features a dark/light mode toggle. Due to time constraints, some aspects of the implementation could be refined and optimized in future iterations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** installed on your machine
